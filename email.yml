    Hey [[[Name]]],


    As you already know, I’ll be leaving my position as [[[job title]]] here at [[[Company]]], and my last day is [[[date|2020-01-01]]].


    While I’m excited about the new opportunity, there’s also a big part of me that’s sad to be saying goodbye to amazing co-workers just like you. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed our time working together, and how much I value the friendship you’ve shown me over the past [[[how long you’ve worked together 3 years, 6 months]]].


    It’s been great working together, [[[Name]]], and I’ll definitely keep in touch!


    All the best,
